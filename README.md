# Ruby and computer science: a self-learning curriculum

I am a former teacher working my way into software development. I am learning Ruby, Rails, and a healthy dose of computer science.

## Objections

*Why Ruby?? Isn't JavaScript the obvious choice for web development?* Ruby is a good first language to master because its ecosystem is stable, the community is experienced, and for me Ruby is very enjoyable to write. Not convinced? [Read this](https://medium.com/learn-love-code/why-teach-ruby-bac8416c77ba) or [watch this](https://youtu.be/IlVfHG-pAag?t=1534).

*OK, but why so many books and courses?? Isn't practice more important than reading?* Yes, you should be spending more time coding than reading, but starting a project and getting into a coding routine is easy (if you can't think of any project ideas, just ["build your own X"](https://build-your-own-x.vercel.app/)), whereas knowing what to read is not at all obvious at the beginning. Hence the larger space devoted to books and courses here. Besides the obvious reasons to undertake serious study (to learn from others so that I don't have to learn the hard way, and of course the bragging rights), I also simply enjoy knowing how things work under the hood.

## Preliminaries

- If you've never written a line of code in your life, you may want to start with the free tutorials at [BigBinary Academy](https://academy.bigbinary.com/learn-ruby) and/or [Learn to Program](https://pine.fm/LearnToProgram/) (or buy [the updated book version](https://pragprog.com/titles/ltp3/learn-to-program-third-edition/)). I studied some computer science in high school, so I had a bit of a head start.
- If you are a working adult, make sure your day job is conducive to part-time studying. Last year I was a first-year schoolteacher. That meant hours of grading in the evenings and on weekends, which would have made studying impossible. For this and other reasons I switched to a remote tech support job, which freed up my evenings and weekends (and early mornings, with no commute).
- Find a system for keeping *organized* notes, code snippets, and articles/videos saved for later. I use a simple text file ([similar to this](https://illdoitlater.xyz/t/plaintext)), which is more effortless than any knowledge base app that I've tried.
- Last but not least, take care of yourself! Studying (especially while working) can easily be overdone. Exercise and get plenty of sleep. If you develop wrist pain from computer use, act swiftly: get an ergonomic mouse and keyboard, do daily RSI stretches, and start using a break app such as [Workrave](https://workrave.org/).

So without further ado, here are my recommendations from what I studied. Resources that cost money are marked with ðŸ’². If you need more free resources, see the links to other lists at the bottom. You may be able to find the books for free (from your local library or more dubious sources) but be sure to buy them when you can, to support the authors. ðŸ™‚

## Frontend basics

- Subscribe to programming newsletters for inspiration. My favorites:
  - [Hacker Newsletter](https://hackernewsletter.com/)
  - [DEV newsletter](https://dev.to/t/newsletter)
- [x] Treehouse's ðŸ’²[Frontend Web Development](https://teamtreehouse.com/tracks/front-end-web-development) track, or The Odin Project's [Foundations](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations) + [HTML and CSS](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-ruby-on-rails/courses/html-and-css) + [JavaScript](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-ruby-on-rails/courses/javascript)
- [x] **Build a blog from scratch:** I have rebuilt it by now, but [here is that first iteration](https://fpsvogel-2020.netlify.app), and [here's how I built it](https://fpsvogel.com/posts/2020/zs). I am also posting some of my learnings on Twitter, whereâ€”confessionâ€”[I sometimes talk to myself](https://twitter.com/fpsvogel/status/1389915714098802692).

  - [Discord](https://discord.gg/tSFdeuVfpc)
  - [Ruby Weekly newsletter](https://rubyweekly.com/)
  - [Ruby Radar newsletter](https://rubyradar.mailchimpsites.com/)
  - Join a local [Ruby meetup](https://www.meetup.com/topics/ruby/all/) and/or [Rails meetup](https://www.meetup.com/topics/ruby-on-rails/all/)
- [x] **Basics:** ðŸ’²[The Well-Grounded Rubyist](https://www.manning.com/books/the-well-grounded-rubyist-third-edition) or [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-programming).
- [x] **Guided practice:** [Exercism](https://exercism.io/my/tracks/ruby), then [CodeWars](https://www.codewars.com) if you want more. Be sure to take notes each time you learn something new in an exercise, and write up a reflection at the end ([here is mine](https://fpsvogel.com/posts/2020/exercism-ruby)).
- [x] **OOP:** ðŸ’²[Practical Object-Oriented Design: An Agile Primer Using Ruby](https://www.poodr.com) (a.k.a. POODR), then ðŸ’²[99 Bottles of OOP](https://sandimetz.com/99bottles-sample-ruby). More than any other Ruby books, these are worth the price tag.
- [x] **Build a Ruby app:** Apply those OOP lessons. I made a CLI (command-line interface) [app that gives statistics on a reading log](https://fpsvogel.com/posts/2021/my-first-ruby-app-lessons-learned). Along the way I also [published a Ruby gem](https://fpsvogel.com/posts/2020/ruby-functional-programming), though in the end I abandoned it because I realized it did more harm than good. All part of the learning processâ€¦
- [x] **Design patterns:** ðŸ’²[Head First Design Patterns](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/head-first-design/9781492077992/). Also [Refactoring.Guru](https://refactoring.guru/) for a catalog of code smells, refactoring recipes, and design patterns.
- [x] **Build a site with Bridgetown:** I [remade my blog](https://fpsvogel.com/posts/2021/build-a-blog-with-bridgetown) with [Bridgetown](https://github.com/bridgetownrb/bridgetown) (an updated Jekyll), and built a Ruby component for [a reading list](https://fpsvogel.com/reading/). Be sure to [join their Discord server](https://discord.gg/Cugms94QFM)â€”the maintainers are very welcoming and helpful to newbies.

## Rails

My app that I'm currently working on is [Plain Reading](https://plainreading.herokuapp.com/).

It's my way of avoiding "tutorial hell": in addition to following the steps in each tutorial for myself (i.e. making my own copy of their app), I take some time after each tutorial to turn that new knowledge into skill by working on my own Rails app.

I'm still not sure what exactly this book is about (even after reading the first few pages) but it is an often-recommended introductory text on "programming". So, maybe someday I will learn this "programming", after I've learned the less intimidating stuff (all of the above).
