# Learning Ruby: a resource list

Hi! As a second-career developer who didn't go through a bootcamp, I've found it helpful to keep notes on learning resourcesâ€”building my own curriculum, in a way. If you have a favorite resource that's missing below, let me know by [opening an issue](https://github.com/fpsvogel/learn-ruby-and-cs/issues/new/choose)!

## Overview

- [JavaScript](#javascript)

- [Other programming and CS resource lists](#other-programming-and-cs-resource-lists)

## Preliminaries

- If you're wondering why I chose Ruby and not full-stack JS, [I explain why on my blog](https://fpsvogel.com/posts/2021/why-learn-ruby). Or if you want a second opinion, [read this](https://medium.com/learn-love-code/why-teach-ruby-bac8416c77ba) or [watch this](https://youtu.be/IlVfHG-pAag?t=1534).
- I list *a lot* of books and courses below, and hardly any hands-on projects. Let me be clear: you should be spending more time coding than reading about coding. But starting a project and getting into a coding routine is easy (if you can't think of any project ideas, just ["build your own X"](https://build-your-own-x.vercel.app/)), whereas knowing what to read is not at all obvious at the beginning. Hence the focus on books and courses here.
- If you've never written a line of code in your life, you may want to start with the free tutorials at [BigBinary Academy](https://academy.bigbinary.com/learn-ruby) and/or [Learn to Program](https://pine.fm/LearnToProgram/) (or buy [the updated book version](https://pragprog.com/titles/ltp3/learn-to-program-third-edition/)). I studied some computer science in high school, so I had a bit of a head start.
- If you are a working adult looking to transition into software development, make sure your day job is conducive to part-time studying. I used to be a teacher and spent hours grading in the evenings and on weekends, which would have made studying very difficult. So I switched to a remote tech support job, which freed up my schedule.
- Find a system for keeping *organized* notes, code snippets, and articles/videos saved for later. I use [a simple text file](https://fpsvogel.com/posts/2021/plain-text-knowledge-base), which is more effortless than any knowledge base app that I've tried.
- Last but not least, take care of yourself! Studying (especially while working) can easily be overdone. Exercise and get plenty of sleep. If you develop wrist pain from heavy computer use, act swiftly: get an ergonomic keyboard ([the one I use](https://fpsvogel.com/posts/2021/keyboardio-atreus) is effective and affordable), [do daily RSI stretches](https://youtu.be/fdD7CgN5FGg), and start using a break app such as [Workrave](https://workrave.org/).

So without further ado, here is my learning path. Resources that cost money are marked with ðŸ’². If you need more free resources, see the links to other lists at the bottom. You may be able to find the books for free (from your local library, interlibrary loan, or more dubious sources) but be sure to buy them when you can, to support the authors. ðŸ™‚

## Frontend basics

- [x] **Learn some HTML, CSS, and JavaScript:** The Odin Project's [Foundations](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations) path is great, but there are [a plethora of other tutorials out there](https://www.google.com/search?q=html+css+js+tutorial).
- [x] **Build a blog from scratch:** I've rebuilt it by now, but [here is the first iteration](https://fpsvogel-2020.netlify.app), and [here's how I built it](https://fpsvogel.com/posts/2020/zs). Building a blog is not only a good exercise in itself, but it might also give you extra motivation to write about what you learn. There are other ways to do that too: I also post some of my learnings on Twitter, whereâ€”confessionâ€”[I sometimes talk to myself](https://twitter.com/fpsvogel/status/1389915714098802692).

## Ruby

- [x] **Basics:** There a few good options here.
  - [The Ruby Programming course on The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-ruby-on-rails/courses/ruby)
  - [Ruby Is For Fun](https://github.com/ro31337/rubyisforfun)
  - ðŸ’²[The Well-Grounded Rubyist](https://www.manning.com/books/the-well-grounded-rubyist-third-edition) (worth re-reading later, as it covers some advanced Ruby)
- [x] **Guided practice:** [Exercism](https://exercism.org/tracks/ruby), then [CodeWars](https://www.codewars.com) if you want more. Be sure to take notes each time you learn something new in an exercise, and write up a reflection at the end ([here is mine](https://fpsvogel.com/posts/2020/exercism-ruby)).
- [x] **OOP:** ðŸ’²[Practical Object-Oriented Design: An Agile Primer Using Ruby](https://www.poodr.com) (a.k.a. POODR), then ðŸ’²[99 Bottles of OOP](https://sandimetz.com/99bottles-sample-ruby). More than any other Ruby books, these are worth the price tag.
- [x] **Build a Ruby app:** Apply those OOP lessons. I made a CLI (command-line interface) [app that gives statistics on a reading log](https://fpsvogel.com/posts/2021/my-first-ruby-app-lessons-learned). Along the way I also [published a Ruby gem](https://fpsvogel.com/posts/2020/ruby-functional-programming), though in the end I abandoned it because I realized it did more harm than good. All part of the learning processâ€¦
- [x] **Build a site with Bridgetown:** I [remade my blog](https://fpsvogel.com/posts/2021/build-a-blog-with-bridgetown) with [Bridgetown](https://github.com/bridgetownrb/bridgetown) (an updated Jekyll), and built a Ruby component for [a reading list](https://fpsvogel.com/reading/). Be sure to [join their Discord server](https://discord.gg/Cugms94QFM)â€”the maintainers are very welcoming and helpful to newbies.
- [x] **Keep up with the community:** You can learn a lot by listening in on what the Ruby community is talking about.
  - [Ruby subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/ruby)
  - [Ruby Weekly newsletter](https://rubyweekly.com/)
  - [Ruby Radar newsletter](https://rubyradar.dev/)

## Rails basics

Only courses are listed below, but be sure to *build stuff* as you learn. [Here's how I started building my first Rails app right from the beginning.](https://fpsvogel.com/posts/2021/first-rails-app-plain-reading) Another invaluable form of practice is to [start contributing to open source](https://fpsvogel.com/posts/2021/how-to-contribute-to-open-source-ruby-rails).

- **Community:**
  - [Rails subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/rails)
  - [Ruby on Rails Link community on Slack](https://www.rubyonrails.link/)
  - [StimulusReflex on Discord](https://discord.com/invite/stimulus-reflex): you don't need to wait until you start using StimulusReflex to join, because these folks are very helpful to beginners struggling with Rails frontend issues in general.
- **General:**
  - [x] [GoRails - Rails for Beginners](https://gorails.com/series/rails-for-beginners) is great for getting started quickly. If you'd like a slightly longer follow-up, try [Ruby on Rails: A Beginner's Guide](https://www.udemy.com/course/ruby-on-rails-a-beginners-guide-free/).
  - [x] ðŸ’²[Ruby on Rails Tutorial](https://www.railstutorial.org) will teach you Rails testing, good Git habits, and how to build an authentication (user login) system from scratch.
  - [x] If you need a review, or if you skipped the Ruby on Rails Tutorial: [Full Stack Ruby on Rails at The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-ruby-on-rails) or (if you prefer videos and/or you're interested in Rails + React) [App Academy Open](https://open.appacademy.io/learn/full-stack-online).
  - [x] [Style guides](https://ruby.style/) for Ruby, Rails, and RSpec
  - [x] [Rails Guides](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/)
- **Testing:** Minitest is familiar at this point. Now it's time to learn RSpec and Rails-specific testing techniques.
  - [x] ðŸ’²[The Complete Guide to Rails Testing](https://www.codewithjason.com/complete-guide-to-rails-testing/)
  - [x] ðŸ’²[Effective Testing with RSpec 3](https://pragprog.com/titles/rspec3/effective-testing-with-rspec-3/)
- **SQL:**
  - [x] Interactive tutorials: [SQL Teaching](https://www.sqlteaching.com), [SQLBolt](https://sqlbolt.com), [SQL Tutorial](https://www.sqltutorial.org/), [Select Star SQL](https://selectstarsql.com), [SQLZoo](https://sqlzoo.net/wiki/SQL_Tutorial)
  - [x] Extra practice: [Wikibooks](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/SQL_Exercises), [w3resource](https://www.w3resource.com/sql-exercises/), [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/sql)
